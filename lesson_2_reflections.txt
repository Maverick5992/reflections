What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
*A .git directory is created which contains the metadata of the repository
We do this to be able to use git on that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
*It is a middle stage where you decide which files from the working directory
are to be committed. This offers some flexibility in making logical commits
