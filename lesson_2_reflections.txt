What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
*A .git directory is created which contains the metadata of the repository
We do this to be able to use git on that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
*It is a middle stage where you decide which files from the working directory
are to be committed. This offers some flexibility in making logical commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
*By double-checking my changes and load only the files that make sense into
the staging area. Then I can check the exact changes that will happen if I
commit using 'git diff --staged'

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
*Branch when you need to experiment or do something outside the main scope.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
*You can see the heads of each branch and find unreachable commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? 
Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
*It creates a new commit with 2 parents containing all the changes done at
both branches
