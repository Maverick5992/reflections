When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
*If I am backing up my project to be accessed from anywhere. Also when I am collaborating
with someone else on the project so we can all make changes and not worry about
harming each other's work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
*Files might change and force me to adapt to them.
