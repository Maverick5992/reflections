When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
*If I am backing up my project to be accessed from anywhere. Also when I am collaborating
with someone else on the project so we can all make changes and not worry about
harming each other's work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
*Files might change and force me to adapt to them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
*Clones copy entire repositories, forks are clones from GitHub to GitHub
and branches are a new string of commits on the same repositories.
I would fork someone else's repository to work on my own copy, clone to upload
or download my work to/from GitHub/Local computer, and branch to experiment
without harming my previous work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
*Helps avoiding merge conflicts when pulling or pushing
